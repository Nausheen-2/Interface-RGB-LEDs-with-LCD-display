# Interface-RGB-LEDs-with-LCD-display
To interface RGB LEDs with an LCD display, connect the RGB LED to PWM pins on a microcontroller (e.g., Arduino) and an I2C LCD for text display. Control LED colors using analogWrite() for PWM pins and update the LCD with messages that correspond to the LED color. This setup allows dynamic visual feedback.
